# 3D Ant Analysis
Functions and scripts used to analyse and plot the data in the form of a 3D skeleton for an animal and the object it interacts with


## Installation

```bash
uv sync
```

Use the ``test_box.ipynb`` to test out the classes and how they interpret files.

## Current Issues

1. MacOS has issues with running pyglet windows and closing them may cause issues. The window may not close on pressing 'Q' and you may need to reset the kernel.
2. ``GLException: b'invalid value'`` - Not sure yet, but re-running the visualiser stops the error.
